# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game project! This is a simple python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three marks (either x or o) before the opponent does.

This project allows you to play Tic Tac Toe against a friend or challenge the computer to a game. It provides a simple and intuitive user interface.

## Features

- Play against a friend: Enjoy a friendly match of Tic Tac Toe with another player.
- Play against the computer: Test your skills against the computer (Beta).

## How to Play

To start playing the game, simply run the main.py file in your terminal and follow the instructions in the console.

The grid positions of the board are equivalent to the number pad on the keyboard:  
7 | 8 | 9    
4 | 5 | 6   
1 | 2 | 3  
Choose the number to put mark in that grid.

Player with 'x' starts the game.  

> ## Future Directions  
> - The computer mode is to be enhanced
> - A better UI can be added
